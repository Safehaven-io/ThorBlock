Min SHA holding requirements To be able to create a Charity project you need a VET wallet that holds at least 25k SHA. See this Medium article for additional token holding requirements. Additionally, to create a pool you will need at least 6.5k VTHO in the same wallet. Before you follow these instructions,make sure you have a wallet linked and funded with the required tokens. On the Start a project page, you will first have to set the funding method. The funding method can't be changed after you have created the project. In the drop-down menu under Thorblock Pool, you can choose to create a new pool address or select a pool address you have previously created. (This option is only available if you have already successfully created a project before.) In the drop-down menu under VeChainThor Wallet, select the wallet from the wallet provider you have chosen to use. This wallet will be the admin wallet and will need to be funded with at least 25k SHA and 6.5k VTHO.

In the field under Funding goal, enter the total amount you want to raise in the token of your choosing.
